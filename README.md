# MIT-Intro-to-Computing-6-0002---Fall-2016-
Code and problem sets from the course (completed independently via open courseware).

Code by me is usually in the python file with the name of the problem set i.e. 'problem set 4.py' or 'pset4.py' etc. 
Helper code is from the course and is included as it is usually necessary for the code to run. 
Folders for each pset usually include the pdf describing the problem. 
I've included files that were intermediate steps in writing the code, usually named 'practice...' or something similar.
I haven't finished pset 5 hence not including it here yet.
